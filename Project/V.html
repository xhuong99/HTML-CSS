	<p>&emsp;V (real name Jihyun Kim) is one of the side characters in Casual Story and Deep Story, and one of the main characters of Another Story. He is the current head of the RFA, however is often offline because of his trips as a photographer and his blindness. He was the fiance of Rika, and fell into a state of depression after her death, but did not show it.</p>
	<p>&emsp;V is a person who often works with Seven together and keeps things as a secret to the RFA members. He is also childhood friends with Jumin, as Jumin has talked about both of them having used to go to the same church and V talking about their schooling times together.</p>
	<h1>Appearance</h1>
		<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/V.jpg" align="right" alt="v" width="32%" height="30%">
			<div align="left">
				<p>V is a tall and lanky character with turquoise eyes and hair. His hair sweeps slightly to the left, just barely covering his eye. Throughout the story, he's often seen wearing a pair of grey dress pants and a loose black shirt (or a black turtleneck) with an open silver suit. Along with his grey boots, he wears a necklace, which is generally silver.</p>
				<p>Due to being a victim of domestic violence committed by his fiancé, Rika, V's eyes are hurt badly, resulting a severe corneal damage from external trauma that almost blind him, which is why he always wears dark sunglasses and a special lens, and can be seen with a cane at times.</p>
				<p>In Secret 001, both his eyes lose their vibrant turquoise color, as a clue that he has turned completely blind. Also in Jaehee's route, Jumin notes that V is already no longer able to see during their meeting.</p>
				<p>During Another Story, V's hair is much longer and shaggier and opts to wear a long brown coat over a button down shirt and slacks. At times, he can be seen wearing the robes of a Believer from Mint Eye as it is his guise to infiltrate the place in order to gain more information about the cult and the MC. During his Good Ending, V's hair is once again short and he wears more comfortable clothes, the necklace usually placed around his neck being replaced by colorful beads and a peace sign, signifying his growth and healing after his abusive relationship with Rika. His blindness is completely cured after receiving surgery and no longer wears sunglasses as he had in Casual and Deep Story.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<h1>Personality</h1>
	<p>V is a person who respects one's privacy. This can be seen when he did not know Rika's password even though the apartment was under his name. He is also the type who keeps everything to himself, to the point where he would rather live with the burden of all his secrets than tell the other RFA members. He did not tell Seven all his secrets until he had no choice. Also, Zen says that although V is famous within the photography industry, he is not well-known amongst the public since he does not like being talked about.</p>
	<p>Jumin has also stated that V is timid and faint-hearted, saying that if someone were to be against hosting the party again, V would talk about not hosting the party again. This implies that he is a people-pleaser and is sensitive toward the opinions of others, which can contribute to why he is a very private person.</p>
	<p>In addition, he is a very loyal person. Although Rika suffered from depression and paranoid delusions with her twisted personality, he never left her and even said, "Even if you strangle my neck, blind my eyes and break my limbs... I will still love you."</p>
	<h1>Background Story</h1>
	<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/V_2.png" align="left" alt="zen31" width="30%" height="30%" style="margin-right:10px">
			<p>As a child, V grew up in a wealthy family. Not much is known about him because he is known to be very secretive. V and Jumin have known each other since childhood for 20 years due to him being neglected by his family during his younger days. Jumin notes that his parents were 'quite strange, but probably because they were artists'. V also appears to have a rather strong connection with Seven, always calling him by his baptismal name Luciel, and only tells specific things to him. Additionally, he had the intention to marry Rika before she passed away.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:15px">In Another Story, it is learnt that V's mother and father were separated and that V rarely got to see his mother. Jumin convinced his friend to learn more and to develop a relationship with his mother and V began to spend time with his mother; V's mother saw V had the soul of an artist and encouraged him to pursue a life of painting, despite her son being reluctant to. V's mother entered an art piece he created into a competition behind her son's back and this resulted in their relationship breaking down as he was frightened of showing his artwork to the public and of his father's reaction. It is later revealed that V's mother died to save him from a fire in their home and V spent much of the years following regretting his actions towards his mother.</p>
