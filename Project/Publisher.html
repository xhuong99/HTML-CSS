	<h3>Introduce</h3>
	<img src="Image/cheritz_logo.png" alt="cheritz logo" align="right" height="50%" width="30%"/>
		<p align="left"> Cheritz was founded on February 2012 in South Korea with the goal of designing and providing Asian style female-oriented games for their consumers. With the reasoning that many more females having an increasing in their economic status as compared with past history, there would be a higher demand for social content that they would be able to indulge in. With that in mind, Cheritz has set themselves a goal to develop female-oriented games that would satisfy this demand. As well as this, they hope to provide products that can be enjoyed by female gamers all over the world (not just Asian females as most would assume would be the only consumers of Asian style games) and also hope the gameplay will be a moving experience. </p>
		
	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>Cheritz develops games that can be enjoyed by anyone (especially females) who are looking for creative Asian style games. They research data on many different female-oriented games and are willing to listen to the voices of female gamers. In simpler terms, they strive to develop enriching and entertaining female-oriented games that can satisfy the demands of their target audience.<br />Cheritz pursues a work environment that is respectful towards everyone; striving to listen to each other in a horizontal position regardless of age, education, experience, and nationality..</p>
	
	<h3>Distribution</h3>
	<p>The demand for female-oriented games is not just limited to South Korea. Cheritz distributes products to Asian countries including Japan, and China and tries to expand to Western countries. The distributions are made online, and often provide translations in certain languages other than Korean in order to achieve this.</p>
	
	<h3>Games</h3>
	<p>Thus far, Cheritz has released four games:</p>
