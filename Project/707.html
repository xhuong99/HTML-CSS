	<p align="center" style="font-style:italic"><span style="color:#FF0000">" It's nice to use the messenger, but you'll get hurt if you try to find out too much about me so be careful! "<br>" Be careful, I am dangerous, you wouldn't want to get too involved with me... "</span></p>
	<p>&emsp;707 (Real name Saeyoung Choi, Baptismal name Luciel Choi) often referred as Seven, is one of the Deep Story characters available in Mystic Messenger. He is a hacker who can quickly find information on anything he can get his hands on.</p>
	<h1>Appearance</h1>
		<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/707.png" align="right" alt="707" width="23%" height="23%">
			<div align="left">
				<p>Seven has scruffy vermilion hair and golden eyes. He usually wears his black jacket with amber accents. He is 175 cm (5' 7") tall, and weighs 69 kg (152.1 pounds). He is always seen wearing his glasses, which are yellow with dark grey (some times depicted as black) stripes. His orange headphones are seen around his neck the majority of the time. He also wears a silver cross necklace..</p>
				<p>Seven changes his outfits very rarely. His attire for the party consists of a white vest decorated with red accents over a black dress shirt and a red tie..</p>
				<p>He does cross dress and cosplay often as the player will be able to obtain pictures of himself in various costumes over the course of game play.</p>

	<h1>Personality</h1>
	<p>For the most part, Seven displays a happy-go-lucky, outgoing, and very bizarre personality. He frequently plays pranks on Yoosung via chat room, makes fun of the other members (and himself), and, in response to just about anything, will respond with a series of "lol"s. He's essentially your typical jokester who loves cars (he owns multiple) and holds a passion for hacking.</p>
	<p>However, the player's first impression of Seven is not the "real" Seven. Outside the chat room, and behind the humorous front he puts up, Seven is actually quite depressed and serious, and he refuses to believe that anything good can happen to him. This is due to his past and his profession, as he thinks that he will endanger anyone he gets close to. This fear is brought up very often during the events of his route, usually when he is trying to push the player away.</p>
	<h1>Background Story</h1>
	<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/707young.jpg" align="left" alt="zen31" width="30%" height="30%" style="margin-right:10px">
			<p>Seven grew up with his younger brother, Saeran, until he was 14 years old (15 by Korean Age), in a toxic household. His father is the current prime minister and a candidate in the current presidential election; their father knew he wouldn't do well in the election if the information that Seven and Saeran were born out of wedlock (by a woman who isn't his wife) was leaked, so their mother decided to hide Seven and his brother in exchange for money. Their mother abused Saeran because he was weaker than Seven and got sick more often. Saeran's punishments included being tied by the legs to the kitchen so he couldn't leave, being beaten, and being starved and dehydrated for days.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:0;padding-bottom:15px">Seven took it upon himself to change their future. Seven studied how to hack using a book he found on computing, promising Saeran that they would run away together. He met Rika at a church, and later on, V. When Seven was 14, V told Seven to take on a new name and work at a intellectual hacking company, but that he was not allowed to take Saeran with him. Seven refused at first, but after a lot of convincing from V, he left Saeran behind, entrusting Saeran's safety to V and Rika.</p>
