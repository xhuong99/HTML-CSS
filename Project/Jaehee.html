	<p>&emsp;Jaehee Kang is one of the characters available from the Casual Story option in Mystic Messenger, and the only female character with a route. She is the chief secretary in the C&R International company and works as Jumin Han's assistant. She is kind and hardworking.</p>
	<h1>Appearance</h1>
		<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/Jaehee.png" align="right" alt="zen" width="15%" height="15%">
			<p align="left">Jaehee is a woman with normal height, 165 cm (5'5"), who weighs 54 kg (119 lbs). She has short brown hair and goldish brown eyes. She wears non-prescription glasses that were given to her by Jumin. She is often seen in a business suit due to her position as Jumin's secretary. She wears a white shirt, a dark brown to black jacket with skirt and shoes and tights. In the after-ending, her hair has grown out long and slightly curled.</p>
		</div>
	<h1>Personality</h1>
	<p>Even though Jaehee is a fairly serious and independent business woman, she is very caring. Jaehee has her own sense of humour and knows how to have a good chuckle at herself and others. That being said, she likes things to be organized and kept in line (One of the reasons she doesn't like taking care of cats; the one hair she misses while cleaning up after them drives her mad). It's very frustrating to her when things do not go according to schedule or if she is saddled with unexpected extra work. But ever the responsible one, she always comes through and deals the best she can despite the challenges her boss and friend Jumin always throws at her both in work and personal life.</p>
	<h1>Background story</h1>
	<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/a00ee3497ae1faed3007eee7887beaed.jpg" align="left" alt="zen31" width="24%" height="20%" style="margin-right:10px">
			<p>Jaehee's mother married a man 20 years older than her, despite her family's wishes. Her father passed away from a disease when she was young leaving her and her mother on their own. When Jaehee was in the 9th grade her mother got into a car accident and later passed away, leaving her to be raised by her uncle despite his wife's wishes. After graduating from high school, she got a scholarship to a top university from which she graduated a year early. She immediately entered the workforce after graduating from college, where she was hired by Jumin Han. Jumin hired her because V proposed the idea of hiring Jaehee to him. She later joined the RFA on Jumin's recommendation.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:15px">In Deep Story, Jumin mentions that Jaehee is Catholic, which she later confirms.</p>
