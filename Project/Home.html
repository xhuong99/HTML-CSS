		<p>&emsp; 4. <span style="font-weight:bold">Phone calls</span>: Players are able to receive an incoming call from one of the 5 characters after some chatrooms or visual novels. The phone will ring for 10 seconds. If the player doesn't pick up during the time limit, the phone call will remain as a missed call and the player is able to call them back after the next chatroom is available, most of the incoming calls. Players are also able to make an outgoing call to one of them in a specific time. They will either pick up or entering a voicemail when they're busy.</p>
