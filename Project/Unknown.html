	<p>&emsp;Unknown (real name Saeran Choi), is one of the main antagonists of the Mystic Messenger. He is the identical twin brother of Saeyoung Choi and a disciple of the organization Mint Eye. During visual novel sequences, prior to the revelation of his identity, his name would be displayed as three question marks (???). In Another Story, Saeran continues to use the screen name Unknown, but now goes by the alias Ray. As of January 31, 2018 he wias able to be romanced as Ray.</p>
	<h1>Appearance</h1>
		<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/Saeran.jpg" align="right" alt="MC" width="26%" height="26%">
			<div align="left">
				<p>He has white hair with light pink tips and mint-colored eyes. He is seen wearing a red tank top with a black patent leather jacket over it. He has a black choker around his neck, as well as a black spiked bracelet on his right wrist. He has a more modernized version of the Mint Eye symbol tattooed to his right arm. At several points of the story events, he wears a black mask that covers the lower half of his face.</p>
				<p>In Another Story, as Ray, his hair is better groomed. He wears a magenta suit, with a blue rose pinned to the lapel. He pairs his suit jacket with a pair tan slacks. However, after his personality has changed to Unknown, he wears a black suit with silver chain collar tips.</p>
				<p>In the past, he had scruffy vermilion hair and golden eyes like Seven.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<h1>Personality</h1>
	<p>Saeran is very hostile and defensive towards everyone, particularly his twin brother, Saeyoung (707). This is due to having been "brainwashed," drugged, and tricked into believing he was abandoned by Saeyoung when they were younger. He has become very paranoid and refuses to trust anyone for fear of being betrayed again.</p>
	<p>In Another Story, Saeran has two different personalities, Ray and Unknown, which is likely a side effect from ingesting Mint Eye's elixir of salvation for several years. The two personalities are aware of each other and are able to communicate with one another. As a hacker, Ray and Unknown have extremely different skill sets with Ray's skills being on par or even being better than Saeyoung's. At the moment which one is Saeran's original personality is unknown.</p>
	<h1>Background Story</h1>
			<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/Ray.jpg" align="left" alt="zen31" width="35%" height="35%" style="margin-right:10px">
			<p>Saeran, along with Saeyoung, is the illegitimate son of a high-ranking politician. Shortly after birth, their alcoholic mother exploited their identities by forcing their father to pay hush money. During his childhood years, he and Saeyoung were abused by their mother, but he received the brunt of it due to becoming ill more often than his twin and, being "weaker", he could not attend church when Saeyoung did. His fondest memories were eating ice cream and sneaking out of his room to see the sky for the first time with Saeyoung.</p>
		<p>Saeyoung dedicated himself to freeing his brother as well as himself by learning how to hack from a textbook. Unfortunately, as Saeyoung's ability to hack grew to a professional level, Saeran was left behind, as his twin was offered a promising job by V that would free him and his brother, but with the price of not telling Saeran where he was going. After Saeyoung's disappearance, Saeran was more vulnerable than before, his mental state extremely fragile, and his mother's abuse became more vicious than ever.</p>
		<p>Under V's promise to Saeyoung to protect Saeran, he and Rika then paid a visit to his house, making a compromise with his mother to let him attend church school, or else they would expose her abusive behavior. One day, after Rika took a picture of Saeran to send to Saeyoung, she gave him a textbook on hacking, asking him to keep it a secret and believing in his potential.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:15px">Shortly after Saeyoung had left and five (or eight) years prior to the start of the game, Rika kidnapped and recruited Saeran into Mint Eye, where he was forced to take numerous substances and brainwashed to believe that Saeyoung had purposefully abandoned him because he was a burden. As Saeran devoted himself to Mint Eye, he had his right arm tattooed with its logo.</p>
