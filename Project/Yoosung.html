	<p>&emsp;Yoosung is one of the Casual Story characters available in Mystic Messenger. Yoosung is a sophomore college student who plays a game called LOLOL and invests too much time into it. Because of that, he does not spend as much time studying for college and neglects his studies. Yoosung is also the cousin of Rika and cannot fully bring himself to believe that she is not alive anymore.</p>
	<h1>Appearance</h1>
		<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/Yoosung.jpg" align="right" alt="zen" width="20%" height="20%">
			<div align="left">
				<p>He is the shortest out of all the male characters, at 171 cm (5'6") and is also the most youthful appearance and age-wise. He has messy, bleached blond hair that he usually keeps out of his eyes with two dark brown hair clips that form an 'X' shape. He has soft violet eyes and a young aura to him in all his photos. His style of clothing usually contains something blue.</p>
				<p>It is stated that Yoosung dyed his hair blond in order to get a girlfriend, but also to perhaps look closer in appearance with his cousin who was also blonde. His natural hair colour is a dark brown was usually well kept. Before Rika's death, it is shown in photos that Yoosung would wear more formal clothes before he went to college.</p>

		</div>
	<h1>Personality</h1>
	<p>Yoosung is a really nice and lovable person, and is described by the other RFA members as 'a real puppy'. Yoosung cares about people a lot and loves to spend time with others. He is naive and believes things that are told to him more often than not, as shown during several of his interactions with 707. As a result, he is often unforgiving to his naive nature.</p>
	<p>Despite his somewhat naive and lighthearted nature, Yoosung is severely depressed after the death of his cousin, Rika, with whom he had a very close relationship with and who he idolized. After the death of Rika, Yoosung lost all interest in his studies and becomes a shut in, rarely leaving for classes and opting instead to play LOLOL in order to cope with the crippling sadness.</p>
	<h1>Background story</h1>
	<div class="app">
			<img src="Image/Yoosung15.png" align="left" alt="zen31" width="42%" height="30%" style="margin-right:10px">
			<p>Yoosung grew up in what he calls a typically normal family with his mother, father and sister. It wasn't until the 6th grade that Yoosung met his adoptive cousin, Rika, and began to spend more time with her at his mother's behest.</p>
		<p>Eventually, Yoosung began to greatly admire and idolize Rika for her kindness and ability to make others happy; Yoosung admits that he even thought of Rika as a "magician" who could bring happiness to everyone. As a result of his close friendship with his cousin, Yoosung eventually joined the RFA and became friends with the other members.</p>
		<p>Rika was a big influence on Yoosung and he decided to apply to SKY University as she had told him to instead of applying to a college closer to him. It was because of Rika that Yoosung decided to become a vet after the death of her beloved Sally, who she loved so greatly.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:15px">Rika had a great hand in shaping Yoosung and his future, making him want to become better and to achieve better results in classes and was the reason he wanted to score top results. Her death shook him so greatly that Yoosung states it was a few days before the realization hit him and the tears wouldn't stop coming. After her death, Yoosung became closed off and unmotivated in life, seeing no point in continuing his studies and finding it difficult to cope with the sadness he felt at her death. Eventually, he discovered LOLOL and used it as a means to escape from his depression, neglecting his studies.</p>
